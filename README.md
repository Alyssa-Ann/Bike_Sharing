# Bike Sharing Challenge

## Project Overview

1. Import data into Tableau.
2. Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in tableau.
3. Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
4, Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards. 


Software: Tableau, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of the Analysis

Using Tableau, import, style, and accurately portray data to create a proposal for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines. Present data that will help describe bike trip analysis of users for potential investors. This includes data on how long the bikes are checked out for all riders, the number of bike trips riders took each hours of a week, and the number of bike trips for riders for each day of the week. The data used will be from New York City's actual bike sharing program with real-life data that can then be analyzed and applie to Des Moines. While the two cities are very different, the fundamentals of the bike share program can be the same. 

## Results ---using the 5 visualizations from delv 2 plus visulzations from the module for  7 total, describe the results of each visualization under the image


### Data Clean Up

Before any of the visualisations could be made, the original dataset had to be cleaned so it could be easily formatted in the visualisations. The tripduration column was originally formatted as an interger, but it would be more easily manipulated if it was shown in time. A new column was created to run the tripduration as datetime. To more easily deal with the gender of the bikers, the gender was changed to string as well. Below are the column lists from before the data clean and then after the clean.
